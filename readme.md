The project aims to develop a SOCKS proxy, a protocol for handling network requests between a client and a server through an intermediary. This project serves as a deep dive into network protocols, providing a hands-on approach to understanding and manipulating TCP/IP communications.


## Tasks
    - [ ] Run the node on mobile without rooting it.
        - [x] Not able to execute binary directly without root permisions. 
    - [ ] Caching on the controller level for recently used requests.
    - [ ] Add http and https proxy as well.
        - [ ] Implementing HTTP proxy should be fairly simple, https would be a different story though.
    - [ ] Add autherization and authentication in controller for SOCKS client and the Nodes as well.
    - [ ] Create a node binary which connects to local servers on the host and communicates with the controller exposing the local host
    - [ ] Add support for multiple nodes
    - [ ] Add computation support in the nodes, i.e. the controller can ask the nodes to do some computations.
    - [ ] Explore how nodes behind carrier grade NATs can connect to each other,
        - [ ] How does brokers in torrent network help to nodes behing CGNAT connect.
